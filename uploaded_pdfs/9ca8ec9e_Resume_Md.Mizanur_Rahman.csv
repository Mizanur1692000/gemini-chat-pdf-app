Research & Publications
 Submitted Research | Customized MobileNetV3 to Enhance YOLOv11 for Real-Time Insect
Detection- A real-time insect detection system by integrating a customized MobileNetV3 backbone into the
YOLOv11 architecture to improve detection accuracy and reduce computational overhead. Trained on the BAU-
Insectv2 dataset (1,806 images, 9 insect genera), the model achieved high detection performance while maintaining
suitability for resource-constrained environments. Delivered a web-based application to assist farmers in timely
pest identification and control, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices.

Mini Projects
 Real-time Sports Fitness Monitoring System for Athletes’ based on Internet of Things (Internet of Things)-
Created a project for the sportsman for testing their current physical availability for upcoming competition. The system is able to determine the
athlete is fit or not and what type of exercise suit for them based on their heart rate. Breadboard, Arduino Uno, Heart Rate Sensor, LED display,
Python were used to accomplish the project."
2," A RELATIVE DATA ANALYSIS ON LUNG CANCER PREDICTION IN BANGLADESH (August, 2023)- Developed a machine
learning model to predict the lung cancer in Bangladesh considering on age, alcohol use, gender, dust allergy, genetic risk, chronic lung disease,
air pollution and so on. The model can provide almost 100% accurate output. Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), machine learning models
(Linear Regression, Decision Tree, KNN), Naïve Bayes were used to build the project.
 Hospital Management System- Built a hospital management system using data structure algorithms, and C++ in Data Structure course.
The information of a new patient can be added, possible to see the information of old patient, information can be updated and deleted using the
system.
